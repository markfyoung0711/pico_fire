pico fireworks controllers

Yes! Below is a schematic description for a Raspberry Pi Pico-based fireworks controller capable of controlling 12 fireworks independently. The circuit uses opto-isolated MOSFETs or relay drivers for safety and separation between the control logic and high-current fireworks igniters.

⚠️ Safety Notice
Only use this for electronic simulation or igniting cold spark or low-voltage resistive test loads unless supervised by a certified pyrotechnician.

Real fireworks are explosive and dangerous. Improper use can result in injury or death.

🔧 System Overview
Controller: Raspberry Pi Pico

Outputs: 12 individual channels for fireworks (igniter control)

Drivers: Optocoupler + MOSFET per channel or relay module (e.g., ULN2803 or IRFZ44N + 4N35)

Power Supply: Separate 12V battery for igniters, 5V USB for Pico

Safety Features:

Arming switch

Status LEDs

Manual override button (optional)

Repeat this for 12 GPIO pins (e.g., GP0 to GP11). You can use optocouplers like 4N35 and MOSFETs like IRFZ44N, or use a relay module with flyback diodes and isolation.

Raspberry Pi Pico (1)

Optocouplers (e.g., 4N35 or PC817) × 12

N-channel MOSFETs (IRFZ44N or similar) × 12

1kΩ resistors (between GPIO and opto LED) × 12

10kΩ pull-down resistors (MOSFET gate) × 12

Flyback diodes (1N4007) if using relays

Firework igniters or test resistors × 12

Screw terminals or MOSFET driver PCB

Arming toggle switch (1)

Power: 12V battery for igniters + 5V USB for Pico

🧠 Code Logic (Sample Idea)
python
Copy
Edit
from machine import Pin
import time

channels = [Pin(i, Pin.OUT) for i in range(12)]

def fire(channel_index):
    channels[channel_index].value(1)
    time.sleep(0.5)  # Fire duration
    channels[channel_index].value(0)

# Example: fire all 12 channels sequentially
for i in range(12):
    fire(i)
    time.sleep(1)  # Delay between fireworks
📐 Optional Features
OLED Display for countdown

Remote control via LoRa or Bluetooth

Fail-safe delay arming logic

Logging or telemetry

🔌 Power Considerations
Ensure 12V battery can handle the peak load of simultaneous igniters.

Isolate the Pico with opto-isolators to avoid back-emf or shorts.

Would you like a Fritzing diagram or KiCad schematic for this design? I can generate one for visual clarity.

Here is a downloadable KiCad project template for your Raspberry Pi Pico 12-channel fireworks controller schematic:

👉 Download RaspberryPiPico_FireworksController.zip

This includes the initial .kicad_sch and .kicad_pro files. You can open it in KiCad and start adding components like:

Raspberry Pi Pico module

12 × Optocouplers (e.g., 4N35)

12 × N-channel MOSFETs (e.g., IRFZ44N)

Connectors, resistors, and power terminals

Would you like me to auto-generate the full component layout and wiring for one or more channels to help you get started faster in KiCad?

Here is the updated KiCad project with schematic components and layout started for one channel of the fireworks controller:

👉 Download RaspberryPiPico_FireworksController_detailed.zip

It includes:

Raspberry Pi Pico module

4N35 optocoupler

IRFZ44N MOSFET

Resistors (1k and 10k)

2-pin terminal for firework igniter

Power symbols for 12V and GND

You can use this as a starting point in KiCad and duplicate the channel 12 times, connecting each GPIO pin (e.g., GP0 to GP11) to a corresponding optocoupler input.

Would you like help wiring up the nets (electrical connections) or creating a PCB layout next?

Great! Now that the schematic components for one channel are in place, we can:

✅ Next Steps
You have two options from here:
Option 1: Wire up the electrical nets in the schematic
This will include:

Connecting a GPIO pin (e.g., GP0) to the 1k resistor → LED side of 4N35

Connecting the transistor side of the 4N35 to the gate of the MOSFET with a 10k pull-down

MOSFET source to GND, drain to one terminal of the igniter

Igniter’s other terminal to +12V

🔧 This step is essential before generating a PCB layout.

Option 2: Generate a PCB layout
Once the nets are wired, I can:

Auto-place components for one channel

Arrange for thermal and electrical safety

Place headers or screw terminals for connecting real igniters

Provide a .kicad_pcb file ready for manufacturing or prototyping

🧭 Which direction would you like to go next?

🧷 “Wire the schematic nets”

🧩 “Create PCB layout”

🧪 “Add test features or safety circuit”

✏️ “Edit the schematic for additional features”

Let me know and I’ll get started!
